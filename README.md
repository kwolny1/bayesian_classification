# Bayesian Cclassification

1. Implementation (from scratch) of LDA, QDA and NB (Naive Bayes) methods for binary classification (classes 0 and 1). Functions:
  * fit(X, y)
  * predict_proba(Xtest)
  * predict(Xtest)
  * get_params
2. Comparison of LDA, QDA and NB methods on simulated data.
3. Comparison of LDA, QDA and NB methods on real data
